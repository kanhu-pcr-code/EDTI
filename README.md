# EDTI: Exogeneous drug target identification tool

##About
The availability of complete genome sequences of pathogenic bacteria and their protein complements in public domain has made it possible to determine potential drug targets in these pathogens using computer-based in-silico techniques. Intersection of two datasets, namely 
[i] a pathogen's subtractive proteome dataset with the host proteome, and 
[ii] the pathogen's minimal essential protein dataset, should represent a set of proteins whose manipulation may reasonably be expected to interfere with the pathogen's survival without adversely affecting the host. 

These proteins could thus act as potential targets for drugs acting against the particular pathogen.
